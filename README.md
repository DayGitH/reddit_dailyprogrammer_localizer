# reddit_dailyprogrammer_localizer
This project fetches all challenges from the [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) subreddit and creates ready to use .py files for each challenge. If it has been used before and previous files already exist, it will only create files for challenges posted after the newest previous file.

I had been completing dailyprogrammer challenges in chronological order. I eventually realized that the mods of that subreddit have not been updating [the wiki page which lists all challenges](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/challenges). This along with the repetitiveness of creating new files for each challenge inspired me to create this project.

Please feel free to help me learn by critiquing.
